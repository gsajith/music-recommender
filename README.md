# Music Recommender

This mini-app generates an "algorithm card" based on several music keyword inputs.

On the back-end, it's using GPT-3 to derive new keywords based on the ones you provide it.

## Important Note
If you want to run this locally, you need to find a way to use HTTPS on localhost.
This was originally written on glitch.com which worked around this problem.

The easiest workaround might be to re-import this back to Glitch and run it there.

## How to Run
(One time) Run `npm install` to install required modules.

Run `npm start` to run in the mode that's set in package.json.

Run `npm run production` to run in production mode.

Run `npm run development` to run in development mode.

## Made with Glitch

Glitch is a collaborative programming environment that lives in your browser and deploys code as you type.

Use Glitch to build anything from a good olâ€™ static webpage to full-stack Node apps.
